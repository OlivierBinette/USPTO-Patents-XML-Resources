# USPTO Patents XML Resources

This repository mirrors [patent XML resources from the USPTO (data documentation and specifications)](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/xml-resources) and provides examples of corresponding data files from [USPTO's bulk data downloads](https://developer.uspto.gov/data).

Two data file examples are provided for each data schema type and version: for the first and last data releases in each of the USPTO-specified version time period. Note that the first data release sometimes uses an outdated data schema version.
